We go over three physical scenarios where Bessel Functions are used. The first 
scenario is the infinite square well quantum mechanical wave function in 
spherical coordinates. The second example scenario involves solving the 
temperature equation for thermal diffusion through a material. The final 
example models the vibration along the drum head right after it is struck in 
the middle.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The Bessel functions of the first kind, $J_n(x)$, are solutions to the
second-order linear differential equation:
\begin{equation}
    z^2\frac{d^2 w}{dz^2}+z\frac{dw}{dz}+(z^2-n^2)w=0,
\end{equation}
\noindent where integer $n=0,1,2\dots$ represents the order of the
function. These functions appear naturally in the separation of variables when solving
partial differential equations in cylindrical or spherical coordinates,
particularly in systems with radial symmetry. Bessel functions also have an
integral
\begin{equation}
    J_n(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\pi cos(x\sin\theta-n\theta)d\theta
\end{equation}
\noindent for integers $n=0,1,2\dots$, which is particularly useful for understanding 
their oscillatory behavior.

\noindent Bessel functions were first introduced by German astoronomer and
mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in the early 1800s during his study of
planetary orbits. However, the equation itself had been investigated earlier
by Bernoulli and Euler in problems involving vibrational membranes
\citet{abramowitz_stegun}. Today, Bessel functions are foundational tools in 
mathematical physics and engineering. In quantum mechanics, they appear in 
radial solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for quantum wells CITE, in the 
vibration modes of circular membranes like drumheads CITE, and in heat 
conduction problems with cylindrical geometries CITE.

\noindent In this project, we numerically compute the first five positive roots
of the Bessel functions $J_0(x)$, $J_1(x)$, and $J_2(x)$. These roots correspond
to physically meaningful quantities such as resonance modes, cutoff frequencies, 
or quantized boundary values in radial systems. We use Python to visualize each
function, estimate locations of roots from their plots, and apply the \texttt{fsolve}
method from \texttt{scipy.optimize} to define each root with high precision.


\section{Data and Observations} \label{sec:data}

This project focuses on computing and visualizing the first five roots of the
Bessel functions of the first kind, $J_n(x)$, for orders $n=0,1,2$. These
functions solve the second-order linear differential equation:
\begin{equation}
    z^2\frac{d^2 w}{dz^2}+z\frac{dw}{dz}+(z^2-n^2)w=0,
\end{equation}
\noindent which arise in physical systems with spherical or cylindrical 
symmetry. The positive roots of $J_n(x)$ represent physically meaningful
quantities such as resonant frequencies or quantized energy levels in such
systems.

\noindent We computed the Bessel fucntions using Python's \texttt{scipy.special.jv}
method, which evaluates $J_n(x)$ for an arbitrary order and argument. To
find the roots numerically, we used the \texttt{fsolve} method from \texttt{scipy.optimize},
which refines an initial guess until it finds a point where the function crosses
zero. We chose a set of initial guesses based on where the function appeared to
cross the x-axis in the plot and passed those values into \texttt{fsolve} to
calculate each root more precisely. We use the following initial guesses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $J_0(x)$: [2, 6.1, 8.6, 11.7, 15]
    \item $J_1(x)$: [3.9, 7, 10.15, 13.1, 16.4]
    \item $J_2(x)$: [5.1, 8.3, 11.8, 14.9, 18]
\end{itemize}

\noindent This gave us exactly five positive roots for each Bessel function. The 
resulting plots of $J_0(x)$, $J_1(x)$, and $J_2(x)$ over the domain $x=0$ to
$x=20$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bessel_roots}, with the first five roots of
each function marked as scatter points.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}


\section{Applications} \label{sec:applications}

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics: The Infinite Square Well}
The Bessel function appears in the solution to the wave function of an infinite
square well in spherical coordinates. To solve the quantum mechanics problem, we
define a potential well:

\begin{equation}
    V(x)=
    \begin{cases}
        0, &\text{if }r < a\\
        \infty, &\text{if }r\geq a
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ and energy operator $\hat{E}$ must also be
defined to compute the wavefunction. The $n$ and $i$ are quantum numbers where $n$
is the principle quantum number and $I$ is the angular momentum quantum number where
both span the integer range from zero to infinity. $\hbar$ is Planck's constant, $m$
is the mass of the particle, $r$ is the radius, and $R_{n,l}$ is the wavefunction in
the radial basis.

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}=\frac{-\hbar ^2}{2m}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} - \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}\right) +V(r)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}\psi-E\psi=\hat{H}R_{n,l}-ER_{n,l}=0
\end{equation}

\noindent Applying the Hamiltonial operator on the wavefunction gives us the
spherical Bessel function in differential form, which looks similar to the
origianl Bessel function in differential form:

\begin{equation}
    r^2\frac{\partial R_{n,l}}{\partial r^2} + 2r\frac{\partial R_{n,l}}{\partial r} +(k^2r^2-l(l+1))R_{n,l}=0
\end{equation}

\noindent To obtain a solution, we impose a boundary condition $j_l(k_{n,l}a)=0$ at the
bounds of the well. This quantizes our solution by setting a discrete energy
level $E_{n,l}=\frac{\hbar^2k_{n,l}^2}{2ma^2}$ where the solution exists. Hence,
we are left with a radial solution to the wave equation containing the original
Bessel Function:

\begin{equation}
    R_{n,l}=Aj_l(k_{n,l}r)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $j_l(k_{n,l},r)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2kr}}J_{l+\frac{1}{2}}(k_{n,l}R)$.


\subsection{Thermal Diffusion}

We define the heat equation propagating through a two-dimensional surface in
the radial direction. $T$ is the temperature, $t$ is the time, $r$ is the radius,
$k$ is the material conductivity, $\rho$ is the density of the material, and $c_p$
is the specific heat capacity.

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}&=\alpha\nabla^2T\\
    &=\alpha\left(\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial r^2}\right)
\end{align}

\noindent where $\alpha=\frac{k}{\rho c_p}$.

To solve this equation, we use separation of variables to split the 
differential equation into two separate differential equations and assume
that one takes the form $T(r,t)=X(r)\theta(t)$. The first equation takes the
form of exponential decay over time:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\theta}{dt}+\lambda^2\alpha\theta=0
\end{equation}

\noindent whereas the second equation is the Bessel function of the zeroth-order
since $\alpha=0$:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2X}{dr^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{X}{r}+\lambda^2X=0.
\end{equation}

We set a boundary condition of $T(r,t)=T_1$, where $R$ is the radius of the circle,
$t$ is time with $t>0$, and $T_1$ is a constant real value. The initial condition for
the radial space is defined as $T(r,0)=T_2$, where $T_2$ is a constant real value.

\begin{equation}
    T^*=\frac{T(r,t)-T(R,t)}{T(r,0)-T(R,t)}=2\sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-\beta_{n}^2 \frac{\alpha t}{R^2}} \frac{J_0(\beta_n\frac{r}{R})}{\beta_nJ_1(\beta_n)}
    \label{eq:T_star}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    T(r,t)=T^*(T(r,0)-T(R,t))+T(R,t)
    \label{eq:T}
\end{equation}

\noindent We define temperature as a unitless quantity $T^*$. $\beta_n$ is the
nth-root solution where $J_0(r)=0$. The temperature function uses both the zeroth
and first order Bessel function in the solution. Hence, Equation~\ref{eq:T_star}
and Equation ~\ref{eq:T} is the final solution for that the temperature takes.


\subsection{Drum Wave Propagation}

Drum wave propagation is similar to thermal diffusion regarding classical wave 
mechanics and quantum mechanics through the quantization of boundary conditions.
We define a wavefunction for the propagation across a drum surface where $\sigma$
is the surface mass density of the membrane and $S$ is the surface tension
across the membrane:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2z}{\partial t^2}=c^2\nabla^2z
\end{equation}

\noindent where $c^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{S}$.

\noindent The first boundary condition is $z(R_f,t)=0$. The displacement from the origin
along the z-axis must be zero at the edge of the drum since those points are
fixed. This condition quantizes the solution, yielding discrete Bessel functions
that satisfy the boundary conditions. To simplify the example, we impose the boundary
condition $z(r,\theta,0)=f(r)$ for $0\leq r \leq a$, representing the initial
pertubation caused by striking the surface at its center. This approach preserves
the $\theta$-dependence in the solution, allowing the Bessel function to appear
explicitly in the radial component.

\begin{equation}
    z(r,\theta,t)=R(r)T(t)\Theta(\theta)=R(r)T(t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    r^2\frac{\partial^2R}{\partial r^2}+r\frac{\partial R}{\partial r}+(\lambda^2r^2-n^2)R=0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dT}{dt}+\lambda^2cT=0
\end{equation}

\begin{eqnarray}
    n=\lambda_{m,k}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    z(r,t)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty J_m(\lambda_{m,k}r)e^{-c\lambda_{m,n}t}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Finally, impose a boundary condition enforcing zero displacement at
the drum's boundary:

\begin{equation}
    J_m(\lambda_{m,k}R_f)=0,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $m$ is the order of the Bessel function and $k$ is the wavenumber.
For $m=0$, the Bessel function itself vanishes at the boundary. There exist infinitely
many integer values of $m$ and $k$ for which this condition is satisfied, corresponding
to the distinct vibration modes of the drumhead. The resulting function $z(r,t)$
describes the final waveform of the drum's vibration in time.
